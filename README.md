# Dominion Randomizer Project
## Timothy Payne

### About
This is a project to generate two Dominion sets when playing online with my friend.
It's complete overkill to make this a fullstack application, but we use Google Meet so I want to be able to display the results in a web app. It's mostly a bunch of effort to practice spinning up a web app and to make my buddy laugh.


This is not a commercial project and all references to Dominion are just my for my own enjoynment.
